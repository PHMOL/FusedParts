A BRIEF HISTORY OF US
We are Philipp Möller and Laurenz Zimmermann, two artists from Munich who are excited about urban street art and creating mixed media art. It has been about ten years since our first project back in school and enjoyed working creatively ever since.

Because we moved to different cities after graduating, we weren’t able to pursue our passion to the fullest. After some detours such as University and our Economic Studies, we reunited in Munich a couple of years ago and decided to pursue our hobby in a more serious manner. Even though we don’t have an artistic background, we engaged in all kinds of different techniques of modern art, so that we were able to transform our ideas into works of art. Our first mission was to fuse various materials in our work, which is why we started with unicolor pictures and vinyl. We were really excited about the effect of vinyl on a canvas, so we kept experimenting with materials such as silk, wood, mirror, resin or steel wool. At this point we try to use new materials in every piece of art and accentuate them with popping colors. Our motives/themes are divers, although we are currently focusing on famous artists from the film and music industry.

In the long run, we will also shift towards abstract art, so we can creatively display our ideas, values and worldview through our artwork.
